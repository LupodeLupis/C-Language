1)	What are the possible return values of the function readRecord? What does this return value represent?
	The possible value that the readRecor can return are:
	1) if the conversion between the  specifiers and the additional arguments is properly done, then the five address will be filled up and the return value will be 5 accordingly.
	2) Any other numbers between 0 and 4 if some the conversion between the specifier and the additional arguments fail.

2)	What is the difference between opening a file in r, w, and a+ mode?
	The dirrerences are:
	1) r mode open the file only for reading.
	2) w mode open the file only for writing and if the file exist the content will be overwritten. If the file doesn't exist it will be created.
	3) a+ mode open the file for reading and for writing. If the file exist the content will be appended to the previous.If the file doesn't exist it will be created.

3)	Briefly explain the value of reading data from a file as opposed to reading all data from user input.
	Reading data from a file save the user to input the data over again because it can be saved and stored persistently.
	On the other hand, reading data from the user input takes more time and the data will not longer avaible therefore the user has to input data more than once. 
	In this case the data is stored momentanely in the RAM.
