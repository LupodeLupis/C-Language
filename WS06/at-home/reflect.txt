1)	In 3 or 4 sentences explain the term “function” and briefly discuss the need for functions in any language?
	Functions encapsulate code that can be used for modularity thorough the program. 
	Functions include a header and a body. The header defines the ruturn type and list the parameters meanwhile the code block contain the list of instructions.
	Functions are needed to avoid code duplication and can be reused. They are helpful because they make the code be more readable and "cleaner".
	
 
2)	Comment on the modularity and reusability of the addPositive and subtractPositive functions. (Hint: Each function was called twice for different purposes each time)
	The two functions allow the code to be more compact and easy to maintain. By writing the two functions I do not have to write the code multiple times in the code 
	and it will be easier for me to apply changes for what I am trying to do.


3)	In 2 or 3 sentences explain how to send data to and receive data from functions? 
	Functions receive data through parameters that are passed to them from the main function or other functions as arguments. 
	Functions send data to its caller using the RETURN keyword.
