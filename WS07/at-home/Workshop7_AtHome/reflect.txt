1)	In 2 or 3 sentences explain the advantage of passing (receiving) values from a function through its parameters rather than through its return value? 
	Passing values  using a Return type (integer, double, float) trough function it can be returned only one value.
	Passing or receveing values through pointer is a dynamic method that allows the function to return with more than one value assigning the address to the variable.
	Also, pointer allow to pass array from a caller to a called function saving memory space in the RAM.

2)	Define the term dereference and identify an example in your code.
	Using a pointer as dereference mean that sign * , for example in a Printf statement, ( in the case the * it acts as non-pointer variable) goes to the variable and pull the value out. 
	In my code the Display Statement which calls the decompose Function works as dereference.

3)	Explain what is stored in a pointer variable. 
	In a pointer variable is stored the address of another variable of the same type. If we consider the example below  we might understand the funcionality
	pointer.Considering the following variable inizialized before the maon function.
		
	int var = 5;
	int  *prt = &var;

	The value of 5 is stored in the variable of type integer name var and  the poiter named ptr store the address of the variable var.
	The value stored in the variale var will be grabbed when  statement will run  inside the  the main function and the pointer will be used as dereferencing.
