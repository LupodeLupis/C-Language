1-	What do you think is the most important thing you learned in this workshop?

I learnt how to use module and how to manipulate variabales with casting.

2-	Why must you add .005 to the value derived when calculating the GST owing?

I must add .005 because the total of the GST wont be rounded correctly with the number that is required to calcualate the balance owing losing 0.01Cents.
It allows to replace the fuction to round up or round down and it force the number of the GST to be rounded at 1.13.


3-	What is the result of a casting operation?

In our exercize the result ot the casting opearting is printing out an interger number as a floating number. It works only for the operation that it is asked to operate
and it doesn't add any value.


4-	Why do you think you were required to use the modulus operator in this workshop?

I think the use of modules has been useful because it allows to narrow mathematical operation such division chopping the fractional part and we had to used because through
the operation of mudulus between integer we could have also practiced the casting operation.
