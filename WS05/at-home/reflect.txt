1)	In two or three sentences discuss the advantages of using an array of structs versus parallel arrays when dealing with related data 

	Even though the performance of a program, whether the struct or parallel array are used is the same, using array of struct can have more advantage in term of managing data.
	The struct of array allows to store under a single name variables of different type, they are also easy to read , undestandand and mantain (in the case the code 
	has to shared with other)

2)	The preferred method of declaring a struct data type is in a header file. Briefly explain why. Hint: this is explained in the notes.
	The header file is a file extension .h and it is efficent because can be shared between more than one source files. 
	When a structure is declared globally it useful to declare it in a separate file
